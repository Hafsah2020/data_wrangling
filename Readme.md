### Data wrangling by Hafsah Anibaba

- This project is to improve my data wrangling skill. It involves:-
  **  Data Gathering: I gathered data from 3 sources:-
    Downloaded  twitter-archive-enhanced.csv and twitter_json.txt from udacity classroom
    retrieved data from https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv as a `.tsv` file using the pytyhon requests library and I saved the file as image-predictions.tsv

  ** I performed visual and programmatic assessments to see dirty and untidy issues in the data
  ** I performed cleaning operations on the data based on the issues identified
  ** I made some analysis on the data to receive some insights
